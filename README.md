# Cline ACP

An [ACP-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com) coding agent powered by [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline).

Use Cline from ACP clients such as [Zed](https://zed.dev)!

## Features

- Context @-mentions
- Images
- Tool calls with permission requests
- Plan/Act mode switching
- Multiple AI model support (via Cline's provider configuration)
- Streaming responses
- Tool integration testing capabilities

## Prerequisites

You need the [Cline CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cline) installed:

```bash
npm install -g cline
```

Configure your API key in Cline's settings before use.
To do this, here are the following steps to follow from the Cline CLI documentation (https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/installation):

```bash
cline auth
```

This will open a menu where you will have the choice between signing in with your cline account or setting up an API key for your preferred AI provider.

If you do not do that, Zed will display a message like "Error ⚠️: OpenRouter API key is required"

## Installation

```bash
npm install cline-acp
```

## Usage

Start the ACP agent:

```bash
cline-acp
```

The agent will automatically connect to an existing Cline instance or start a new one.

### With Zed

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   npm install -g cline-acp
   ```

2. **Configure Zed** by adding the agent server to your Zed `settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "agent_servers": {
       "Cline": {
         "type": "custom",
         "command": "cline-acp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

For more information about Zed's external agents, see [Zed's External Agent documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents).

### Other Clients

Any ACP-compatible client can use this agent. Learn more about the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

## How It Works

This adapter connects to Cline via its gRPC interface:

```
┌─────────────┐     ACP      ┌─────────────────┐    gRPC     ┌─────────────┐
│ ACP Client  │◄────────────►│    cline-acp    │◄───────────►│ cline-core  │
│   (Zed)     │   (stdio)    │                 │             │             │
└─────────────┘              └─────────────────┘             └─────────────┘
```

Cline handles all file operations and tool execution internally.

## Image Support

Image attachments (screenshots, images) are supported when using a vision-capable model in Cline:

- Images are converted to data URLs and passed to Cline's API
- The model must support image/vision input (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4V)
- If you switch to a non-vision-capable model, you'll see an error: "No endpoints found that support image input"

To use images, simply paste or attach them in your ACP client (e.g., Zed).

## Known Limitations

Due to limitations in the Cline CLI's gRPC interface, some ACP features are not fully supported:

| Feature                    | Status        | Notes                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Line numbers in file edits | Not available | Cline's `ToolMessage` struct doesn't include line number fields. File paths work, but jump-to-line is not supported. |
| Available commands         | Not available | Cline doesn't expose a list of available slash commands through its gRPC interface.                                  |

These limitations are upstream in the Cline CLI and would require changes to the [cline/cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) repository to resolve.

### Known Issues

- **Model switching during retry**: If you switch models while Cline is retrying a failed API request, the session may become stuck. Workaround: Cancel and start a new session.
